# Complaint Answering Chatbot (RAG) for CrediTrust Financial
This project builds an intelligent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot to help internal teams at CrediTrust Financial quickly explore and understand customer pain points across five major product lines:
   - Credit Cards
   - Personal Loans
   - Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)
   - Savings Accounts
   - Money Transfers

It uses real consumer complaint narratives from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) dataset, retrieved through semantic vector search and summarized via large language models (LLMs).
## Motivation
- CrediTrust faces critical bottlenecks
- Customer Support is overwhelmed by incoming complaints.
- Product Managers struggle to identify top issues.
- Compliance & Risk teams are reactive rather than proactive.
- Executives lack visibility into emerging pain points.
